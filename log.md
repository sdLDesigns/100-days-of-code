# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I worked on a Trading Signal in Multcharts using Powerlanguage/EasyLanguage

**Thoughts:** I was able to test the new signal using old data but there are some things I need to work on with the trades

**Link to work:** Range Motion is the new signal I cannot push the code to GIT it's not for public consumption
